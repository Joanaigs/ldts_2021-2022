# We present to you our version of Pac-Man!

In this version you can find Pac-Man, which is the character the player plays, coins that have different properties and ghosts that haunt Pac-Man trying to catch him!

The game goal in our version is that Pac-Man eats all the coins without being caught by the different ghosts while the difficulty, in this case the velocity of the ghosts, increases.

**Good luck trying to escape the ghosts and collecting as many coins as you can!**
